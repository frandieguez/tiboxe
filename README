== Welcome to TiBoXe server

TiBoXe server is a web-aplication server that allows to work with terminologic
information based on translations from open source projects translations.

TiBoXe stands on TBX format, a standar that allows to exchange terminologic
information with XML files.


== Getting Started

1. At the command prompt, starts the server using the <tt>script/server</tt>
   (run with --help for options)
3. Go to http://localhost:3000/
4. Follow the guidelines to start using TiBoXe and fetch information from
   different glossaries


== Console

You can interact with the domain model by starting the console through <tt>script/console</tt>.
Here you'll have all parts of the application configured, just like it is when the
application is running. You can inspect translations and concepts, change values, and save to the
database.

== dbconsole

You can go to the command line of your database directly through <tt>script/dbconsole</tt>.
You would be connected to the database with the credentials defined in database.yml.
Starting the script without arguments will connect you to the development database. Passing an
argument will connect you to a different database, like <tt>script/dbconsole production</tt>.
Currently works for mysql, postgresql and sqlite.
